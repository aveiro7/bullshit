Solving flow-shop problem with simulated annealing.

Problem
-------

Given sequence of m ordered machines, set of n tasks and C_max - deadline. Each task has assigned execution time for each machine, and gain for completion.
A valid solution is sequence of tasks, which overall execution time is <= C_max.

Optimal solution is a valid solution with maximal gain.
